# Python-Samples
This repo contains some Python scripts samples with different topics, focused on helping beginners and as a reminder for others.

Each file listed below has a specific purpose that will be described in this README and in the specific python script docstring, so people could search here for specific keywords or search the whole cloned project.

> Since Python 2.X deprecation comes in 1 January 2020 ([Python Countdown](https://pythonclock.org/)), this repo  will entirely support Python 3.6+. So I Strongly encourage you to try installing [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to support multiple Python versions easily.

# Samples:
* **arguments.py**: Shows different application scenarios for *required*, *positional* and *key* arguments.
* **decorators.py**: Show how to create *simple* and *argument ready* decorators, applications and main features.
* **os_path.py**: Handle multiplatforms paths with pathlib module, creating paths and manipulating files.
* **equality.py**: Understanding the difference between '==' and 'is' and curiosities.

# Running Scripts:
To run any script, just type on terminal:

```$ python <sample_name>.py``` 

# How to test:
comming soon.

# Thanks for Read and Support!
